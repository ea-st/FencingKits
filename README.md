## Fencing Kits! : A solution to a really overpriced fence building cost! 


Tired of permanently staining your world by disassembling every appliance in a 5 mile radius, just to build two fences? <br>
Would you like to avoid using unappealing wooden walls?
*Do you wish you had more friends?*

**Well here's a answer for two of those questions, Fencing Kits!**

### Items
Unbundling One Fence Kit gives:

* 12 Metal Pipes
* 1 Chain Roll  (Equivalent to 25 units of wire.)

This is enough for 3 big wired fences, constructed via the metalworking context tab. <br>*(only available with a propane torch, welding mask and metalwork knowledge)*<br>
__*Propane Torches, Welding Masks, The Metalwork Magazine Vol. 3, and Scrap Metal are **NOT** included!*__

It is possible to re-bundle fencing kits after un-bundling them!

### How To Use
Just right click the fencing kit to unbundle it.
You can unroll the chain roll to get wire, or mangle it with a saw and hammer to get some scrap metal.
You can then construct them via the metalworking context tab (Right Click, view requirements above).

### Spawns
Around three to five fencing kits can spawn in a large warehouse.
Farming crates, garages, and tool store containers also spawn fencing kits (Although rare).

### Durability Specifics
The big wired fence, and the big pole fence, both have 700hp, regardless of metalworking skill.
With the Handy trait, it is bumped up to 800hp.
For comparison, a Log wall with level 10 carpentry has 900hp, or 1000hp with Handy.

### Compatible with existing saves!
in order to get new loot in existing saves, you will need to loot new regions.
